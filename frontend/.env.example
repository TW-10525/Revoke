# Frontend API URL - used by React app
# For development: use /api (Vite proxy will handle routing)
# For production: use your actual backend URL like https://api.yourdomain.com
VITE_API_URL=/api

# Backend server URL - used only by Vite proxy during development
# Default: http://localhost:8000 (when running dev server and backend on same machine)
# For dev tunnel or remote backend: set to your machine IP, e.g., http://192.168.1.100:8000
# Note: Only applies during 'npm run dev', not in production builds
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
